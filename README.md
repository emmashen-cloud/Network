# Network
The attached CSV file contains some products (such as carrots and eggs) and the nutrients they provide (such as vitamin A and folates). Write a program that shall use the file to build a bipartite network of products and nutrients (a bigraph). The program then shall find each of the four centralities mentioned in the class presentation for each network node. The program shall further draw the network (use nx.draw_networkx), save it to as a PNG file, and report the node(s) with the highest of each centralities. The program must use networkx for all tasks for network construction and analysis.

In a brief report, answer the following questions:

Which nodes are the most central in each of the four senses?
Do they represent products or nutrients?
How would you interpret your findings?
